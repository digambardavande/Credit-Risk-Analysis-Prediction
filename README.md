# Credit-Risk-Analysis-Prediction
This project aims to predict the **risk of credit default** using customer financial data from the **"Give Me Some Credit"** dataset (Kaggle)
# 💳 Credit Risk Analysis & Prediction using Logistic Regression

## 📌 Overview

This is an end-to-end **Credit Risk Modeling** project using the **Give Me Some Credit** dataset from Kaggle. It involves exploratory data analysis, statistical testing, logistic regression modeling, performance evaluation, and final reporting.

Designed to help financial institutions predict whether a customer is likely to default on a loan in the next two years.
